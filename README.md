# Airgead-Banking

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
> The Airgead Banking application was created to allow its users to calculate their compound interest with an intitial investement amount during a duration of time. The application takes input from the user and displays a chart showing interest growth every year with and without additional monthly deposits. 

# What did you do particularly well?
> During the developement process I felt that I was able to successfully implement a multiple class program through the use of OOP (Object Oriented Programming). This was the first time that I was able to get a program to run with multiple files and class implementation. It did take time but using my pseudocode helped me stay on track.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
> Eevn though I was able to create multiple files/headers doesn't make my code efficient. I later realized that the code was confusing in some parts do to the multiple files for such a simple program. Once I get more comfortable in C++ I plan to revisit this code and optimize it to become only a two file program (main and 1 additional class file). This would help me be able to still have ability to be maintained over time but more condensed. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
> The most challenging part of this project was getting my calculations to print accurately. I knew what I wanted to output but was having a hard time getting the calculations correct. I was able to overcome this by printing the information in plan english on paper and then creating the variables that I needed to take the place of the those calculations. Writting it out in plan english and adjusting some the the variable names for easier understanding helped alot. One of the resources that helped me get through some of the confusion was youTube. I'm a visual learner and sometimes I need things explained to me thorugh examples and graphics. This has been the best way for me to learn a hard topic.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
> The use of header files in the project helped me become a more effiecient coder. I like coding but always felt that writing all my code on one main class could become hard to edit when looking for a certain part in over 100's lines of code. Working with classes only added to this anxiety. When I learned about header files, it actually excited me. Being able to successfull implement it in this program made it even more special to me. I will ALWAYS use header files.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
> My main focus on this project was to focus on maintainability and adaptation. I felt wanted to create as little information in main as possible to show how well I could practice OOP and header/driver files.
